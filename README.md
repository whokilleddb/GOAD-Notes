# GOAD Notes 

This bunch of notes are a way for me (a complete noob) to document learning about some AD basics through the [GOAD Labs](https://mayfly277.github.io/posts/GOADv2-pwning_part1/).

However, this blog will be slightly different as compared to a normal walkthrough because I will try to use a C2 wherever possible, which in my case would be [BRC4](https://bruteratel.com/) - and use my own BOFs and tools whenever possible. 

This blog hopes to emulate an Assumed Compromise scenario more than anything else and even discusses somethings from a tool dev perspective as well.
